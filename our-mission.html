					<h1>We are the gaming historians</h1>
					<p>Our mission is to document and archive information and artifacts about videogames first hand.Since its inception in the 1950s, many of the people who first decided to combine interactive entertainment with a graphical display such as a monitor or a TV set have passed-away. In some cases, the stories these people had to tell are lost forever or only live on in second or third-hand renditions. This is why we strive to preserve the artifacts and their stories as much as possible.  </p>

					<h1>Our Mission</h1>
				</div>
				
				<p>The goal of the National Videogame Museum is to document, FIRST HAND, as much information about the creation and evolution of the videogame industry as possible and preserve as many physical artifacts as possible for generations to come.  As the vast majority of the people who created the videogame industry had no idea how enormous it would become and therefore never really saw much importance in what they were doing.   </p>

				<p>  This is why here at NVM, we value the importance of being the historian of video games, and strive to preserves the legacy of video games, no matter how obscure they are. </p>

		  <p>In 2010, John Hardie, Sean Kelly and Joe Santulli partnered up and founded the Videogame History Museum, aiming to share their passion of videogames to the world. In 2016, their vision has finally materialized as the National Videogame Museum is opened in Frisco, TX. </p>

		  <p>None of what you see right now at NVM will come into fruition without the dedication and hardwork of our founders. Click the link below to learn more about them.  </p>

						<h1>The Timeline of consoles</h1>
						<p>Though the videogame industry is fairly young in the grand scheme of things, there have been over 50 game consoles released in North America. The very first home console (Magnavox' Odyssey) found its way into homes in 1972. Our physical timeline of consoles places 50 of them all in one place! You can step up to a timeline control panel and direct it to tell you more about any of them: when was it popular? How many games were made for it? What was it competing with? What were some of its best and worst features? This area will serve as a central database that will connect all of the stories you'll find in the museum.</p>

						<h1>Pixel Dreams - A Retro Arcade throwback</h1>
						<p>Part of the every day experience at the museum is our retro arcade, "Pixel Dreams". If you lived through the years when you "got next" by placing a quarter on the cabinet, you'll instantly remember the sights and sounds of our arcade. Attendees get four NVM tokens upon admission, but you could spend a whole day working on mastering our games. Are you good enough to get your name added to our leader board?</p>

						<h1>Prehistoric Gaming</h1>
						<p>Prepare yourself for the most amazing display of "dedicated home systems" ever. PONG has never been so BIG! You'll also get to see Nintendo's very first forays into the videogame world with their versions of Pong, Breakout, and Night Driver. How was the world introduced to videogames? What did we do before there were cartridges, discs and the internet? What does a "serve" button do? Explore these early days of videogaming with us in an exhibit like no other.</p>
